    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sintes Telegram Bot</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sintes Telegram Bot (@Sintes_bot) is developed to help users manage their daily tasks and integrate their schedules with Google Calendar using voice commands and text inputs. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information</strong>: When integrating with Google Calendar, the Bot requires permission to access your calendar. We collect OAuth tokens to allow communication with Google Calendar, such as adding, updating, and deleting events.</li>
        <li><strong>User Input Data</strong>: The Bot collects text and voice messages you send to add, delete, or modify tasks in your Google Calendar.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: If you choose to share your location, the Bot may collect your geographic coordinates to determine the correct time zone for your calendar events.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Calendar Integration</strong>: Your OAuth token and calendar data are used solely for managing your Google Calendar events as per your commands. This may include adding, updating, or deleting events.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Recognition</strong>: Voice messages sent to the Bot are processed to extract text and help add tasks to your calendar. We use a third-party speech recognition service to convert voice data into text.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Zone Adjustment</strong>: Location data is used to determine your time zone, allowing events to be correctly scheduled in your Google Calendar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take your data security seriously. All sensitive information, including OAuth tokens, is stored securely and is only accessible by the Bot. We use industry-standard encryption methods to protect your data and ensure it is not shared with unauthorized parties.</p>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties. The Bot only uses the collected data to provide the intended service of managing your Google Calendar events. Data is processed securely and never shared without your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2>User Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data. You may revoke the Bot's access to your Google Calendar at any time through your Google Account settings. You can also delete any tasks or information provided to the Bot.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Bot's functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here, and you will be notified of significant changes.</p>
